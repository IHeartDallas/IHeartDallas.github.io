  <h2>Online Tech Education</h2>

  <div class="content-area">
    <P>Over the past two years I set out to enhance my web and software development skills.
      Even though I am a tech writer and am not new to the software industry, this was and is still is a challenging
      journey.
      While I completed a qaulity online program, it only piqued my interest to learn more.
      I believe many concepts and skills were never addressed or covered.
      Like many other self-taught developers, you run into many road blocks and finally hit the wall -- Where do I go
      next!
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      Since technology drives our world, I strongly believe there is a need for qaulity online tech offerings.
      Consequently, I would like to share my experience with you in the event that you might have a client that is in
      this industry. I would be glad if you could share this critique of the industry. Thank you kindly for your time
      and consideration.
    </P>

      <p>An array of online materials exist. However, there is NOT a particular source that integrates all the necessary

      <h1>Presentation</h1>
      <p>Most online learning formats do not include enough practice problems or projects. Consequntly, this diminishes
        a student's retention of the material.

      <h1>Feed Back</h1>
      <p>Many online programs do not offer timely responses to questions. This is unusual since we also have so many
        tools at our
        disposal such as Zoom, Skype, and Slack.

      <h1>Antiquated</h1>
      <p>Tech curriculum quickly becomes outdated. Consequently, students find themselves quilting material together.
        This creates content gaps. </p>

      <h1>Coding Boot Camps</h1>
      <p>There are quality and reputable coding boot camps. However they are expensive and their locations/times are
        prohibitive for many.</p>

      <p>Both two and four-year institutions do not include relevant tech offerings. Those that do, all tend to
        outsource their offerings via the same organizations.</p>
