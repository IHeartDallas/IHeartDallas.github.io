  <h2>Online Tech Education</h2>

  <div class="content-area">
    <P>Over the past two years I set out to enhance my web and software development skills.
      Even though I am a tech writer and am not new to the software industry, this was and is still is a challenging
      journey.
      While I completed a qaulity online program, it only piqued my interest to learn more.
      I felt as though so many concepts and gaps were missing in this learning experience.
      Like many other self-taught developers, you run into many road blocks and finally hit the wall -- Where do I go
      next!
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      Since technology drives our world, I strongly believe there is a need for qaulity online tech offerings.
      Consequently, I would like to share my experience with you in the event that you might have a client that is in
      this industry. I would be glad if you could share this critique. Thank you kindly for your time and consideration.
    </P>
